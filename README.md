# "Data Cleaning Repository Overview"

# Datasets:
# * Data_cleaning.csv *: The primary input dataset.
# *output.csv *: Another input dataset.

# **Preprocessing Steps (Data Analytics using Python)**
# 1. Libraries Utilization:
Numpy, Pandas, and Missingno libraries were employed: These libraries provide powerful tools for efficient data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

# 2. Handling Missing Values:
Identification of Missing Values: A thorough analysis was conducted to pinpoint any missing values within the dataset.
Imputation or Removal: Strategies were implemented to either impute missing values with appropriate data or remove instances where data was unavailable.

# 3. Handling Duplicate Values:
Identification of Duplicate Rows: Duplicated entries were identified within the dataset.
Removal of Duplicates: Duplicate rows were actively removed, ensuring the dataset maintains uniqueness and integrity.

# 4. Data Exploration:
Basic Visualization Using Missingno Library: The Missingno library was harnessed for creating insightful visualizations that aid in understanding the distribution of missing values and their patterns within the dataset.

"These proactive steps not only ensure data integrity but also enhance the overall quality of the datasets, laying a robust foundation for subsequent data analytics processes".
